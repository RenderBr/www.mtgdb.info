A card database and tools for "Magic: The Gathering".

To get the project running locally you will need Xamarin Studio (OSX), MonoDevelop (Linux), or Visual Studio (Windows). The dependencies not on nuget can be found in the dependencies folder.

You will also need to get and have running locally api.mtgdb.info https://github.com/planeswalkers/api.mtgdb.info

You can run this project in the background by opening console window and going to the src directory of the api project and run "xsp4 --port 8082". You should test that the api has all the dependencies, compiles, and runs in the IDE of your choice first.
