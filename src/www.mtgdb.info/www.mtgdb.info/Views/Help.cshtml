<h4>What is this ALPHA version thingy?</h4>
<p>
    This is a very early release, we expect hiccups and bumps. However, we want to make this tool as great as possible!!!
    Please give us your input and bare with us as we create awesome software for you! Getting input early is key, 
    thats why we will make small releases consistently, until a point when we know it is stable, then we will move onto 
    BETA.

<h4>I can't sign in, sign up, or reset my password, HELP P P p p ...?</h4>
<p>Contact Us!</p>

<h4>What is the benefit of signing up?</h4>
<p>
    When you sign up, you get access to great tools such as "MyCards" where you can keep record of your card inventory.
    Tools will be enhanced and added on a regular basis. 
</p>

<h4>After I sign in, why are some cards grey?</h4>
<p>
   This is to indicate that you do not have this card in your inventory. You can add cards through browsing the set binders,
   searching and in the My Card sections.  
</p>

<h4>On My Cards, All I see is cards I own. How can I see cards I don't have?</h4>
<p>
   Each set tab is a toggle button. Once a tab is active, you can click the tab again. The tab will turn green indicating
   the tab is showing all cards. You will now see all cards available and cards you don't own will be grey. You can then 
   mouse over and add cards on the popover. 

   To see only the cards you do own again. Click the tab agian. It should no longer be green and only displaying cards in 
   your library.
